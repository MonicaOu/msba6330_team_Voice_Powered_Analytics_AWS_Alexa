## Combatting Dashboard Fatigue: Voice-Powered Queries in AWS

Current business intelligence approaches face some issues. First, there’s a general over-reliance on dashboard-centric approaches to business intelligence. Dashboards can be great, but they may not be the best solution for every scenario. Secondly, with dashboards can come a steep learning curve. Technical and non-technical users alike have to learn how to physically log in to a dashboard, then figure out how to navigate the variety of controls, views, and other functions employed in the dashboard. This takes time and can leave users frustrated after struggling through the process, especially if the people building the dashboard design it how they like, not how the people who actually use the dashboard would like it. Lastly, dashboards can give a sense of information overload. There can be so many dashboards, and each dashboard can display a ton of information, leaving your specific KPI tough to find. This is amplified when the KPIs you’re interested in are spread across multiple dashboards. More logging in, more searching, more time consuming.

All three of these issues combine to induce dashboard fatigue in business intelligence end-users. Surely there must be a more flexible solution.
